# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

Step 1:

Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation.

Step 2:

Import the sys module to use the built-in functions.

Step 3:

Get input from the user for number of rows and add it by 1 for number of columns.

Step 4:

Using np.zeros() set the matrix as null matrix.

Step 5:

Using nested for loop get input from the user for each element in the matrix.

Step 6:

Using nested for loop find the ratio and perform the elementary row operations and find the final matrix.

Step 7:

Use back substitution method to find the value of the variables and print it.

Step 8:

End the program.

## Program:
```

X = np.zeros(n)

    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j] = float(input())
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][i] == 0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected')
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]
X[n-1] = a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]
for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    X[i] = a[i][n]
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        X[i] = X[i] - a[i][j]*X[j]
    X[i] = X[i]/a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,X[i]), end = ' ')

```

## Output:
